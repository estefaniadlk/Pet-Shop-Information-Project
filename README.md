# Pet-Shop-Information-Project

**Pet Shop Information System Project**

In the collaborative execution of this project, our team successfully implemented a C program designed to emulate the functionalities of an information system for an animal welfare company, colloquially referred to as a pet shop throughout our development process.

The program encompasses the following features:

*Insert New Stray Animal Details:*

Allows users to input information for new stray animals, such as stray dog ID, breed, age in years, age in months, and sex.

All details are systematically stored in a text file (.txt).

*Delete Stray Animal Registration:*

Empowers users to selectively remove stray animal registrations directly from the code.

*Search Stray Animal Records by Breed:*

Facilitates efficient retrieval of stray animal records based on their breed.

*Update Breed Name:*

Enables users to modify and update the breed name associated with a particular stray animal.

The program maintains a text file that initially contains the count of saved records, followed by the comprehensive details of each recorded animal. For the sake of simplicity, our focus was predominantly on dogs. The specific information stored for each dog encompasses:

Stray Dog ID
Stray Dog Breed
Age of Stray Dog (in years)
Age of Stray Dog (in months)
Sex of Stray Dog

The program is able to automatically sort records based on the dog's breed during the insertion process, fostering an organized and easily navigable data structure.  

This project is a testament to our team's proficiency in creating a streamlined and functional information system tailored to the needs of an animal welfare company, ensuring efficient record-keeping and retrieval while promoting simplicity and ease of use.
